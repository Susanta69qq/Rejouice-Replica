This is a replica of an award winning website from Rejouice.com. Libraries used for the execution of this project are Gsap, Locomotive JS, ScrollTrigger, SwiperJS and a few others.
This is an excellent project for elevating your animation skills. Please feel free to throw in your suggestions if any. The project though incomplete in the truest sense, has all the necessary
tools for the implementation of all effects and animations for the website.
